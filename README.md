# High-School
Coding programs I completed in High School during Intro to CS (python), APCS A (Java), and ABCS (Java). These programs were often introductory assignments to basic Java and coding concepts (2D arrays, binary, class, abstract classes, etc.)

# 2D Array Transformations
This program flips a 2D array horizontally or vertically, and can reverse the matrix.

# Binary Calculator
This program takes two numbers whose sum is â‰¤255, and converts the numbers to a 8bit binary. The two number's binary is then added together to get the sum, also in binary. 

# Clock
This program keeps track of time in standard military format (6pm would be 1800). It can increment in minutes, looping back when an hour or day as been changed. 

# HighSchool Member Tracker
This program keeps track of students and faculty/staff at a high school. 

# Light Strand Tracker
This program keeps track of a strand of lines and whether the bulbs are on, off, or burnt out.

# Simple Calculator
This program takes in an expression of the format of a string, and performs the given operations and returns the result of the expression in an integer form.

# Vigenere
This program follows the Vigenere cipher. 

# War Card Game
This program simulates a game of war between two players, no interavtion is required. 

# RandomExercises.py 
This program contains three exercises
1) Uses a ditionary to store the odds of rolling two dice adn their corresponding sums
2) Creates a password that has the following requirements: Between 8-10 chracters, contains atleast one special character, atleast one number, atleast one upper case letter, and one lower case letter.
3) Create a deck of cards and deals X amount of hands with Y amount of cards in each hand.
